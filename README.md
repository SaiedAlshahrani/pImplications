# Performance Implications of Using Unrepresentative Corpora in Arabic Natural Language Processing

We, in this repository, share with the community our evaluation scripts for ([Word Representation Task](https://github.com/SaiedAlshahrani/performance-implications/tree/main/Word-Representation-Evals) and [Language Modeling Task](https://github.com/SaiedAlshahrani/performance-implications/tree/main/Language-Modeling-Evals)), created datasets ([Arab States Analogy Dataset (ASAD)](https://github.com/SaiedAlshahrani/performance-implications/tree/main/Word-Representation-Evals/ASAD) and [Masked Arab States Dataset (MASD)](https://github.com/SaiedAlshahrani/performance-implications/tree/main/Language-Modeling-Evals/MASD)), extracted corpora ([Wikipedia Corpora Creation](https://github.com/SaiedAlshahrani/performance-implications/tree/main/Wikipedia-Corpora-Creation)), and trained models ([Training Scripts](https://github.com/SaiedAlshahrani/performance-implications/tree/main/Word-Representation-Evals/Training-Scripts)) for our accepted paper, **[Performance Implications of Using Unrepresentative Corpora in Arabic Natural Language Processing](https://webspace.clarkson.edu/~alshahsf/unrepresentative_corpora.pdf)**, at *[The First Arabic Natural Language Processing Conference (ArabicNLP 2023)](https://sites.google.com/view/wanlp2023)*, co-located with [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/) in Singapore (hybrid conference), December 7, 2023.
